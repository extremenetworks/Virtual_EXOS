# BGP with route redistribution to and from OSPF

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of BGP.  There are three separate BGP ASes, and two OSPF ASes.

Note: These projects were built for the EXOS-VM_v32.7 images.  Make sure the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.

>Note: ECMP is not supported in EXOS-VM. This is because ECMP requires hardware support, and the required hardware is not emulated in the VM.
