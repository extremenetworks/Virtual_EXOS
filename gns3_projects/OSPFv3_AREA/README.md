# OSPFv3 Area example GNS3 project

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how different OSPFv3 area types are configured using IPv6.  In the picture below you can see that each area shows a example of a different way to use a OSPF area.

Note: These projects were built for the EXOS VM 32.7.2.19.qcow2.  Make sure the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.
