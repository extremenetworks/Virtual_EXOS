# ERPS With Major And Subring Rings 

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how ERPS is configured in EXOS with both a major ring and a subring (ITU-T G.8032v2).

*Note: These projects were built for the EXOS-VM_v32.7.2.19.qcow2 image. Make verify the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.*
