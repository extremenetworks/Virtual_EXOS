# Two tier MLAG example GNS3 project

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how Two tier MLAG is configured.  Vlan Data is across all switches.

Note:These projects were built for the EXOS-VM_v21.1.1.4-disk1.qcow2 and the EXOS-VM_v22.1.1.5-disk1.qcow2 images.  Make sure the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.

>Note: The MLAG failover may take up to 10 sec becasue of limitations with GNS3 and qemu devices.  LLDP was used to allow failover to happen.
