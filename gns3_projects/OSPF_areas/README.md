# OSPF Area example GNS3 project

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how different OSPF area types are configured.  In the picture below you can see that each area shows a example of a different way to use a OSPF area.

Note: These projects were built for the EXOS-VM_v32.7.2.19-disk1.qcow2, Make sure the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.

>Note: in this example /24 networks are used as P2P links.  You would normaly use /30 for P2P links.  I wanted to make the last Octet of the IP to reflect the Switch #.
