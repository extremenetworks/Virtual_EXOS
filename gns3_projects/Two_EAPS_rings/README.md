This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how Two EAPS rings connected together with CFM is configured. Vlan Data is across all switches and CFM is used with EAPS to protect against logical failures.

*Note: These projects were built for the EXOS-VM_v32.7.2.19.qcow2 image. Make verify the image is loaded into GNS3 before you import the project.*
